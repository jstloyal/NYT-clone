                        CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth,
                         with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his 
                        notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.

                        He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic 
                        particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might 
                        have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic 
                        evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing 
                        the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.

                        wrinkles and irregularities. 
                        Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.

                <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the
                     Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
                </p>
                <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole,
                     a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples 
                     in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched 
                     violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the 
                     long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether 
                    it could ever be proved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark
                     energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and 
                     energy to science and speculation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its 
                    hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture
                    and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes
                    bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.

                In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the 
                forces operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth 
                and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct 
                observation of gravitational waves, 
                which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
            </p>
            <p>Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe 
                expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
            </p>
            <p>He continued, “This is a signal from the 
                very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral 
                patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and 
                preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as 
                hot as the surface of the sun.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for 
                Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a 
                scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics
                 here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

                    The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis.

                    By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation 
                    had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists 
                    responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if 
                    this stays true, it will go down as 
                    one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a 
                    competing project called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed.
                     “I think the results are beautiful and very convincing,” he said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that 
                    posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, 
                    the Bicep result would 
                    eliminate his model, but he expressed reservations about inflation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for 
                    confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature 
                    maps of the cosmic background by the European Space 
                    Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own 
                    findings this year. At least a dozen other teams 
                    are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.
                </p>
                <h3>Spirals in the Sky</h3>
                <p>
                    Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, 
                    which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert 
                    Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four 
                    leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive 
                    radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. 
                    The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of 
                    Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the 
                    ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. 
                    “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.

                        The Bicep2 telescope, in the foreground, was used to detect the faint spiraling gravity 
                        patterns — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart at its birth.

                    In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation 
                    was polarized, meaning the light waves had a 
                    slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves 
                    from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another 
                    as they go by, would twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. 
                    As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have 
                    little arrows going in spirals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature 
                    of the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is 
                    basically a giant superconducting thermometer.
                </p>
                <p>“We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.</p>
                <p>
                    The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning 
                    up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying 
                    that competitors might beat them to the breakthrough.
                </p>
                <h3>A Special Time</h3>
                <p>
                    The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists 
                    like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break 
                    point in the evolution of the universe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity, 
                    electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that 
                    those are simply different manifestations of a single unified force that ruled 
                    the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, 
                    like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other. 
                    The laws of physics evolved, with one force after another splitting away.
                </p>
                <p>That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>
                <p>
                    Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the 
                    temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, 
                    at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long.
                     In that case, space itself 
                    would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a 
                    kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up. Since it was space 
                    itself supplying the repulsive force,
                     the more space was created, the harder it pushed apart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion 
                    trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy 
                    to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary 
                    particles and radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s 
                    observable universe, a patch of sky and stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said 
                    that there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say,
                     “but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”
                </p>
            </div>

        <div class="article-2">
            <p>
                Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from 
                Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our 
                own universe settled down to a comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will 
                continue blowing up, 
                spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the multiverse.
            </p>
            <p>
                So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not 
                bother asking about going any deeper into the past.
            </p>
            <p>
                We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, 
                because inflation erases everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of 
                the primordial moment are swept away, forever out of our view.
            </p>
            <p>
                “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian 
                astronomer who was not part of the team, “you wind up at inflation.”
